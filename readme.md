# As the Light Grows
- A short side-scrolling game meant to make the player think about the consequences of light pollution in the real world. 
- The player plays as a “shadow creature” that must avoid the light. As the levels progress, the area in which the levels take place gets more and more populated (village -> city) which will be a challenge for the player. 
- Each level will also depict one or a few of the real consequences light pollution has on animals, and upon completion of each level, there will be a short info graphic/slide explaining the situation that the player witnessed. (ex. Lights attracting bugs to where they shouldn’t be)
- This game is meant to promote awareness about light pollution and its effects on animals, as it is often overlooked.
